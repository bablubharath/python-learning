# Python Task Scripts

This repository contains two simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic programming logic using conditional statements and loops.

---

## `task1.py` - Even or Odd Checker

This script prompts the user to enter a number and determines whether the number is even or odd.

### How it works:
- It reads a number from the user using `input()`.
- Converts the input to an integer.
- Uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is divisible by 2.
- Prints whether the number is "Even" or "Odd".

### Example:
```bash
Enter a number: 4
4 is an Even number
```

## `task2.py` - Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50

This script calculates and prints the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.

### How it works:
- It defines a `range` from 1 to 50.
- Initializes a variable `total` to 0.
- Iterates through the range and adds each number to `total`.
- Prints the total sum along with the range information.

### Output:
```bash
The sum of numbers from 1 to 51 is: 1275
```

> Note: The `range(1, 51)` includes numbers from 1 up to 50.

## Usage

To run the scripts, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python task1.py
python task2.py
```

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
