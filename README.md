# Python Basic Input and Operations

This project contains two simple Python tasks to demonstrate basic input handling, arithmetic operations, and string formatting.

## ‚úÖ Task 1: Arithmetic Operations

This script takes two numbers as input and performs the following operations:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

### Example Input and Output:

```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Execute

1. Make sure you have Python installed. You can check using:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

2. Save the script (both tasks) into a `.py` file, for example: `script.py`

3. Run the script using:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen input prompts.

## üìÑ Notes

- The program uses `input()` to read data from the user.
- Division will always return a float result.
